# Power-Supply-fault-detection-using-MLP
This project focuses on predicting faults in a DC-DC power converter using a simulated dataset and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The goal is to build a robust and professional machine learning pipeline that can be used in real-world scenarios for early detection of power converter faults.
